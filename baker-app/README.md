# Introduction
This application enables customers, to order specified birthdaycakes. During corona it is hard to visit the shop, so thats why the application is created. You can create an account and after this you're able to order a cake to your preferences. A cake can be modified with a size, an image, a deliver date, a shape and some notes.
